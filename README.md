# Neural Network 838 Encoder Decoder
Modeling 8-bit binary input using 8-3-8 shaped neural network


## Decription
This code is to manulay construct a three layered neural network. The input layer has a size of 8, the hidden layer has a size of 3, and the output layer has a size of 8. The main goal is to map (encode and decode) an 8-bit binary signal from the input to the ouput.
